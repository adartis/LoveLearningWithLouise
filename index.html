                        <p>Miss Ryan has been my teacher and tutor for three years. She encourages me to get our of my comfort zone and does not hold me back. For example, a few months ago Miss Ryan challenged me to enter the BBC 500 Words competition and I made it through to the second round, whereas if I did not have her, I probably would not have even tried and I would have lost an opportunity.</p>
